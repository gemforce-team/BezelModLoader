## BezelModLoader

Bezel Mod Loader (Bezel for short) is a modding API for GC:FW.

It is very basic at the moment, created to simplify updating my mods for new game versions, loading them, ensuring compatibility, etc. 

Nevertheless, I've aimed to make it flexible and expandable, so even in its current state it is capable of loading arbitrary mods (assuming they follow a certain internal structure, documentation is a WIP). These mods then have access to the entire game's internals.

## List of known mods

Follows a (possibly incomplete) list of mods that can be installed on Bezel.

* [Autocast](https://github.com/gemforce-team/Autocast): Autocasting mod 
* [Gemsmith](https://github.com/gemforce-team/gemsmith): Automatically performs complex gem combinations
* [ManaMason](https://github.com/gemforce-team/ManaMason): Quickly place arbitrary groups of structures
