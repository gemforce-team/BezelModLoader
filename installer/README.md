# Bezel Mod Loader Installer
### Compilation
This should be run in an environment that includes with mingw-i686.
Building is as simple as building Bezel, then building the installer.
Note that building the installer may require specifying the CXX and AS commands to be used.
(Example: `CXX=/mingw32/bin/g++.exe AS=/mingw32/bin/as.exe make` instead of `make`)
